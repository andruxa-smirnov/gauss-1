To compile with some number of threads
g++ -O3 -pthread -std=gnu++0x -fopenmp -o gauss main.cpp gauss.cpp -DNTHREADS=2

matrices are 2d arrays of doubles
c style pointers to array of pointers

randomly generated matrices are filled with doubles between 1 and 10000

 for k = 1 ... m:
   Find pivot for column k:
   i_max  := argmax (i = k ... m, abs(A[i, k]))
   if A[i_max, k] = 0
     error "Matrix is singular!"
   swap rows(k, i_max)
   Do for all rows below pivot:
    for i = k + 1 ... m:
     Do for all remaining elements in current row:
      for j = k ... n:
       A[i, j]  := A[i, j] - A[k, j] * (A[i, k] / A[k, k])
     Fill lower triangular matrix with zeros:
     A[i, k]  := 0
